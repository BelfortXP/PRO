@input
clk 	clock signal we need
in		carry from the lower bit
rst_n	enable signal

@output
out_in			carry to the higher bit
[3:0] out_q1	higher decimal
[3:0] out_q2	lower decimal

@function
the time of minute or secend. if !rst_n then refresh the clock showing otherwise make clock walk normally

@implementation
each time determine whether the out_q2 is
equal to 9 or not, if yes, then out_q1 increases
by 1 and set out_q2 to 0 since we use BCD code to
represent the number of time. as for the reason why
to choose BCD counter instead of binary counter, that
is BCD counter are much easier to be decoded.
