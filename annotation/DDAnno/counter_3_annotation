@input
clk		the clock with frequency we need
in 		the carry from minute time
rst_n	enable signal

@output
[3:0] out_q1	the higher bit of hour decimal
[3:0] out_q2	the lower bit of hour decimal

@function
if !rst_n, then refresh hour time to zero, otherwise 
walk the hour time normally.

@implementation
each time when clk is changed, check whether 
10*out_q1 + out_q2 == 23, if yes, then make the hour
time as zero, otherwise we check if out_q2 achieves to
9, if yes then increases out_q1 by 1 and refresh out_q2
to zero. to avoid logical leak, check whether the time
has reached 23 should be put first.
