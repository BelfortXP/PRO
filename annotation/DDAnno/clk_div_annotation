@input
clk, rst_n

@output
clk_out

@function
if ~rst_n, then refresh the clk_out signal
otherwise, clk_out would be the specified clk we want

@implementation
the function of this module is to get a clk with specified n Hz frequency
we use a cnts signal to detemine when the clk should be reversed. 
since there is a 100MHz clk embeded in artix-7 chip already,so we can get
parameter cnts = 1e8(100M) / n; we just need to count a variable from 0 to
cnts, then a period would be finished. as long as the variable achieve half
of the cnts, then we reverse the count variable to show that half period had
been passed.
